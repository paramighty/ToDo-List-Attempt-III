# ToDo-List-Attempt-III

The To-Do List Attempt III is a simple web application for managing a to-do list. This was done by following an youtube video by "Code with Ania Kub√≥w". Users can add new tasks, edit existing tasks, and delete tasks that have been completed. The app is built with a React front-end and an Express back-end connected to a PostgreSQL database.

2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd ToDo-List-Attempt-III`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`
4. Create a PostgreSQL database named `todos` and import the `todos.sql` file to create the necessary table.
5. Start the server: `npm run dev`
6. Open the app in your browser at `http://localhost:3000/`
